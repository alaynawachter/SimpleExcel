Simple_Excel_Tools is my base Excel Add in. It is designed in mind for visual data analysis in excel, but can be used by anyone. Free to use, change, distribute.
I am an engineer really good at environmental data analysis. VBA is a bonus hobby, so the quality of my code reflects my self-taught freedoms :) 

Add on contains:
  Round Simply - A tool to round all selected cells to significant figures or set number of decimals.
  Merge Simply - A tool to merge all selected cells based on combining like or empty cell values
  Reset Limits - A very simple line of VBA to reset sheet limits
  Highlight - A conditional formatting tool that highlights the row and column a user is working in
  Hide Row/Column - Hide all rows or columns in a selection that are empty
